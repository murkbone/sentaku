## FAQ
### What is Scrinium?
Scrinium is a singleplayer text-based puzzle game. Solve puzzles to advance through a strange file you found on an eerie website.

### When will the game be released?
TBA

### What happened to Auxilium?
Auxilium was cancelled because I personally found the game challenging to develop, losing motivation and eventually got bored of the project. One of the main reasons for this was the constant bugs and issues with making a multiplayer experience. Scrinium is a singleplayer, slightly tweaked version of the project I always wanted to create; this time with better management.

### What about the old Auxilium levels?
While some old levels will appear in Scrinium, most if not all Auxilium levels will be available through Stop N' Swop when the Alpha launches. 

### Can I play multiplayer?
Only in the Auxilium Stop N' Swop DLC levels.

### Is this a free game?
Yes

### Can I contribute / donate?
No

### Are you looking to translate the game?
Possibly

### Other platforms?
99% no
